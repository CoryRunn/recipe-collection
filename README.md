Recipe Collection

Here's a fun little project from Skillcrush.com. They provided the HTML markup/style-guide and tasked me with adding the CSS. The assigment also asked me to use floats. At this point, I was already diving deep into flexbox, so I had to work my brain to remember how floats worked lol. I should probably go back to it, start over, and try building it with flexbox. There's just not enough time in the day!!!!!
